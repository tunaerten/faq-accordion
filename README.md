### Built with

### What I learned

This project was helpful for recognizing new HTML semantic elements. I also had the opportunity to familiarize myself with using ARIA labels. After completing the project, I tested it with Lighthouse and Axe DevTools, becoming more accustomed to these tools. Although the project was quite simple, I learned a lot of new things.
